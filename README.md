# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview

This project is part of my Data Science virtual internship at CodSoft. The objective is to analyze the Titanic dataset and build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival of passengers. Using various data science techniques, we aim to uncover insights from the data and develop an accurate prediction model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers on the Titanic. The dataset includes features such as:

- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger (0 = Male, 1 = Female)
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
- **Fare**: Passenger fare

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Programming language used for analysis and modeling
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for building predictive models

## Project Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: 
   - Load and inspect the dataset
   - Handle missing values
   - Explore and visualize the data to understand relationships and patterns

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Normalize/scale numerical features
   - Split the data into training and testing sets

3. **Model Building**:
   - Train a Logistic Regression model
   - Evaluate the model using accuracy and other metrics
   - Tune the model to improve performance

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Analyze model performance
   - Validate the results using cross-validation

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarize findings
   - Discuss potential improvements and future work

## Results

The final model achieved an accuracy of **XX%** on the test set. The most significant factors influencing survival were identified as:

- **Sex**: Females had a higher chance of survival
- **Pclass**: Passengers in higher classes (1st class) had a better chance of survival
- **Age**: Younger passengers were more likely to survive

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the factors affecting survival on the Titanic and demonstrated the application of data science techniques to real-world problems. Through this internship, I have enhanced my skills in data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.
